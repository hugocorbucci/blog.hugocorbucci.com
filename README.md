Hugo Corbucci's Postach.io blog theme
=====================================

## Getting Started

This theme uses LESS for CSS precompiling, and it uses Gulp for compiling the LESS into CSS, and also for concatenating and minifying JavaScript files.

### 1) Install Node Modules

Run the following command in Terminal to install Gulp for LESS preprocessing.
```
npm install
```

### 2) Run Gulp

Run gulp to make sure all CSS and JavaScript files are the latest versions.
```
gulp
```
